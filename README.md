# Mixed messages

This project is a *message generator* program.

## How does it work?

Whenever a user runs this program/project it generates a random message over a given topic.
The topic that is given is static, meaning that it can't be chosen.

### Features

* expanded topics

    With this feature I expanded the various topics that the message generator can generate. The topics are:

        - Basketball
        - School
        - Programming

* user input

    User can now enter the topic that he/she wants to be generated.
